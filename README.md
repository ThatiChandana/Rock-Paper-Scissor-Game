#ThatiChandana.Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
This poject was done as a part of Project Expo - "Gameleon 2022" @BVRIT.

Gameleon was a 24-hour hackathon challange where in, we were given a list of 10 game themes and were supposed to build any one of those games within 24 hours. We were successfully able to complete the challenge and submit the game on time.

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissor game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
